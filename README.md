# Parking Brake Toggle: For FSUIPC and the A320 by FlyByWire

The great team of FlyByWire has decided to break away from the usual used interfaces of FSUIPC regarding the parking brake. Since e.g. many virtual airlines depend on the parking brake being set within FSUIPC, this small program is intended to remedy the situation.

# Usage

Download the latest release version from this repository and unpack it. Then run the program by launching ```main.exe```, which sets the parking brake.

# Contributions

I appreciate any participation in this code. Here's a little guideline on how you can help the community improve this little workaround:

1. Clone this repository to your lokal drive.
2. Make your changes inside the source-code.
3. Create a pull-request to push your changes into the main code.
